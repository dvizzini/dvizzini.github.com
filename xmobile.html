It is a mobile platform on which to preform behavioral science experiements.

			<a href="http://xmobile.berkeley.edu">xmobile.berkeley.edu</a> is a joint and proprietery venture of the College of Engineering and the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, for which I was the first software engineer. It is a mobile platform on which to preform behavioral science experiements.

			To preform such experiments, I coded its API using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> and <a href="http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">Tastypie</a>, as well as an <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">Android</a> client that featured geofencing capabilities, timers, persistent memory, and scalability through abstraction.

		<p>
			In addition, I supervised the development of an HTML client for in-lab experiments.

			Over the summer of 2012, xmobile was successfully implemented in a small run of <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w16791.pdf">this behavioral economics experiment</a>. Various members of the Berkeley faculty intend to use it for larger-scale studies.
